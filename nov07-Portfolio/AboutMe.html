<p>
  Hello my name is Elvis Garcia i'm sixteen years old. I was born in Mexcio in March 5, 2000, My parents moved to america to work. I was lefted in mexcio with my grandma and grandpa, I stayed with them for four years. In February 28, 2005, five days before my fifth birthday I was brought to Tulare from Mexcio. My parents picked me up from tulare, for the next 5 years i lived in selma going to Terry Elementary School. This was my grade school until begininng of 6th grade, when my dad move us to Yakima, Washtigton for better work. I went to school there for 6 months,  then my dad's friend conviced him to move to Missouri to get a job cutting lawns. My dad agree to move, because it could be better than picking apples in Washigton.
</p>
<p>
  I then Lived in Independence, Missouri for a year, I moved back home for two reasons. One reason was that my dad didn't a job as a lawn mover, but as a Mechinaic. Well the job was to stressful so he was thinking of quiting and getting another job. The second was, one day the boss man didn't get a part my dad need to fix a car so  my dad went to get it at the junkyard. He got it then he paid for it and then the bosss man calls him to ask where he was at. My dad says at the junkyard and his boss ask him to get another part. My dad agree to get it, since the part was small and wasn't expense he deicded to throw it over the fence and get it with out paying. Well securty saw him and call the police, he said that he would pay for it, but they said no that he had to take him to jail for stealing. Later they called immgration, just because he was Mexican. That started a process of deportion, my dad hired a lawyer and was able to stay here for about a year then he had to go to court agian.
</p><P>
  My dad decided to move back to cali I came to selma and went to Alms(Abraham Lincoln Middle School) until we moved to a house close near to selma, but i went to RJJH(Rafer Johnson Junior High) There I met Monty, Kevin, Cobi, Eric, and my other friends I promoted and went to KHS(Kingsburg High School). Sophmore year Monty, Cobi, and some other people joined Geekwise and they told me about it. Also became legal thanks to daca on my 16th birthday. I later chose Geekwise for my elective, but missed the meeting so i thought i couldn't join until Monty told me that they hadn't started. So i wented to the office and asked that if is stil could take Geeekwise and they said that i could. So i took it, later this year my dad was called into court and they told him that he had to move before jan 18. So i my dad leaves december 27 and i move March 17ish</P>
