  <h1>But, what's up with the spelling???</h1>
  <section>
    <p>

    It's true, The Berrock Shop is spelled differently. Back in 1989, when we<br /> purchased the restaurant from two elderly ladies with an awesome recipe<br /> for bierocks, we asked them the same question. In fact, at the time there <br />were a couple of other bierock places in town, with the third spelling,<br /> "beerock." You see, back then, "beerock" though incorrect, was actually<br /> the most widely accepted spelling for this beloved Russian-German<br /> favorite.

      The ladies who originally started The Berrock Shop decided to spell their<br /> restaurant, "berrock" because they felt it was more phonetically<br /> correct...closer to the actual pronunciation. In addition, they wanted to <br />distinguish themselves from their competition.    </p>

  <h1>Through the years</h1>
  <section><p>
    Through the years, the public has become more educated about bierocks,<br /> and now the correct spelling is more prevalent than ever. But when we<br />  took over The Berrock Shop, we didn't dare change what the two ladies<br />  had begun back in 1977...and as we discovered after almost thirty years,<br />  as long as you make great bierocks, people don't care how you spell<br />  them...and the rest, as they say...is history.
